TODO:

- Make sure resources are loaded only once.

- Fix offsets in draw-image (shouldn't need transformations).

- Polygon smooth hint?

- Add align, scale, mirror and angle options to DRAW-IMAGE*.

- Better clipping.

- Structured color values.

- Utilities for interfacing with CL-Imago.

- Better drawing primitives. Real lines, complex polygons, start/end args to draw-circle etc.

- As always, optimise GL state handling. Blitting in batches, possibly VOBs.

- Implement "tiles" and animation.

- Box/box/line/circle etc. overlap functions, faster v-dist.

- Correct aspect ratio when fullscreen on widescreen displays.

- I would really like to see it run on OS X.

- Documentation and tutorials.



As separate projects on top of PAL:

- GUI, work in progress.

- Native CL font resource builder.

- TTF support.

- Some sort of sprite library?

- Network code?
